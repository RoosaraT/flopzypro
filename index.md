## F.A.Q
*Answer a few frequently asked questions;*

**Can you read my messages?
*This project is open source so all the codes are clear. Neither less nor more; you can look what you want. We absolutely do not have access to your accounts.*

**What about our security?
*If you are concerned about security, you can install it on your own computer. If you think someone else has captured your data, simply click on Whatsapp> Three Dots> Whatsapp Web> Logout from all sessions button.*

**Is it paid?
*Of course not. It will never happen.*
